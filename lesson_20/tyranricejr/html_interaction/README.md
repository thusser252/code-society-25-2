# HTML Interaction Demo

This project is a demonstration of interactive, mobile-responsive UI components built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## Features

- **Tabbed Component**: Switch between different content panels using tabs.
- **Accordion Component**: Expand or collapse multiple sections independently.
- **Rotating Photo Gallery**: Browse through a set of images, showing up to three at a time, with local images and responsive layout.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser. No internet connection is required.
2. Interact with the tabs, accordion, and photo gallery to see their functionality.
3. The gallery uses images from the local `images/` folder. You can replace these images with your own if desired (keep the same filenames or update the JavaScript array).

## Mobile Friendly

- All components are designed to be responsive and touch-friendly.
- Gallery navigation arrows are spaced for easy tapping on mobile devices.
