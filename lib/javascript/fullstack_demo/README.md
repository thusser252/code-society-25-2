# Full-stack App Demo

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a fully working task management app built using NextJS and TypeScript. The app is deployed live on Vercel at https://code-society-25-2.vercel.app/

## Running the app

To run the app, copy the [.env.example](./.env.example) file as `.env` and setup the Clerk keys by setting up an account at https://clerk.dev. Once done, you can start up the local dev server with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

The app is built using the React library running on the NextJS framework. The homepage is located at [src/app/page.tsx](./src/app/page.tsx) and contains the main `TodoApp` component.

The `TodoApp` component and sub-components uses `fetch` to get data from the backend API which is located at [src/app/api/todos/route.ts](./src/app/api/todos/route.ts).

The backend API gets a repository instance from [src/repositories/index.ts](./src/repositories/index.ts), using an environment variable to choose between a JSON repository implementation or a Redis version. For more on the repository pattern, [see this article on Medium](https://medium.com/@pererikbergman/repository-design-pattern-e28c0f3e4a30).

## Connecting to Redis

By default, the app is configured to store data on the web server in a JSON file (./src/repositories/db.json). You can connect it to a Redis database by creating one on Vercel (called Upstash KV). Then, set the `DB_TYPE` to `redis` in the `.env` file and configure the additional config keys listed in `.env.example.redis`.

## Deploying live

To deploy this app, sign up for an account on Vercel and create a project pointing to your fork of this repo. You'll need to configure the environment variables you setup in your local `.env` file using the Vercel UI.

## Testing

The application includes both unit tests (Vitest) and end-to-end tests (Cypress).

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress and Clerk

The app is configured with Cypress for end-to-end testing, including authentication testing with Clerk.

1. Set up testing environment:
   - Create a `cypress.env.json` file with your Clerk testing keys:
   ```json
   {
     "CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY": "your_clerk_publishable_key_for_testing",
     "CLERK_SECRET_KEY": "your_clerk_secret_key_for_testing"
   }
   ```

2. Run Cypress tests:
   ```bash
   # Open Cypress test runner in interactive mode
   npm run cy:open:e2e
   
   # Run tests headlessly
   npm run cy:run:e2e
   ```

3. Authentication approach:
   - We use Clerk's Testing Tokens approach to bypass the UI authentication flow entirely.
   - This avoids cross-origin issues that would require `cy.origin()`.
   - The `setupClerkTestingToken()` function from `@clerk/testing/cypress` handles authentication behind the scenes.
   - This allows tests to directly access protected routes without redirects to Clerk's authentication domain.

4. Test example:
   ```typescript
   import { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/cypress';
   
   describe('Authentication Test', () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       // Set up authentication token - no UI interaction needed
       setupClerkTestingToken(); 
       
       // Visit protected route directly
       cy.visit('/');
       
       // Verify authentication successful
       cy.get('header').find('button').should('exist');
     });
   });
   ```
